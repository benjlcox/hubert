Hubert is the hub for all of my connected devices. Living on a Raspberry Pi in my basement and interacted with via SMS, Hubert will eventually control or interact with:

- Philips Hue
- Nest Thermostat
- Fitbit Aria
- Wemo Switch 

Additionally, Hubert will also have a scheduler (jobs queue) built in that will allow for both scheduled events for my connected devices but also rudimentary personal assistant abilities (SMS based reminders - kinda like a shitty Siri).
